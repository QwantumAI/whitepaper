Dumper Shield

Traditionally, those who receive tokens at a discount have hurt communities by selling tokens at a discount, also known as "dumping" tokens on the community. To address this issue, projects began using vesting models that lock discounted tokens for a period of time, often with cliffs or other distribution schedules, which usually end with a large distribution at the end of the vesting period. However, this model created a race to the bottom, leaving investors asking whether they should hold out, hoping everyone else will do the same, or dump and potentially beat other dumpers despite losing to slippage.
To address this dilemma, the Dumper Shield was developed as a dynamic vesting model designed to protect the community by removing exposure to the dumping dilemma. Its goal is to drive liquidity safely to token holders during the vesting period, with the aim of reducing sell pressure once the vesting period ends.


The Dumper Shield allows investors three options to engage with liquidity during the vesting period: 
Transfer 
Decentralized OTC 
Gateway
Transfer  
The transfer function works similarly to a private peer-to-peer transaction, allowing users to send tokens to a specific wallet address or set of wallet addresses. These transfers can be made for free or in exchange for receiving payment using native tokens like ETH or BNB. Receivers of tokens through transfer are subject to the same vesting terms that apply to the user transferring the tokens.

Decentralized OTC
The decentralized OTC (over-the-counter) system allows users to list and transfer tokens to other users anonymously, without any pre-engagement and without negatively impacting the project's market price. Buyers who trade for tokens through OTC are subject to the same vesting terms as the seller. Consequently, when a new buyer trades for tokens, a smart contract is automatically triggered to create a new vault with the tokens, receiving the same Dumper Shield terms.

How it works 
Users can list tokens for sale or place bids to buy, indicating the desired amount and price. The ask or bid price can be fixed or adjustable based on the token's market value. Counterparties have the option to accept offers fully or partially, and any remaining amount will be automatically listed for future buyers without the seller or buyer needing to take any action. Payments are processed directly to the seller's wallet, outside of the Dumper Shield.


Asks vs bids 
The Dumper Shield is a feature that enables sellers to place ask orders and buyers to place bid orders, creating a marketplace for the buying and selling of tokens. Sellers can specify the amount of tokens they wish to sell and the price they are asking for, while buyers can indicate the amount they are willing to buy and the price they are willing to pay. This allows for a more efficient and transparent way of trading, as buyers and sellers can directly interact with each other without the need for intermediaries or any personal engagement over social media chat. 
Virtual vaults 
Buyers can store their funds in virtual secure vaults and make unlimited bid orders without actually locking their funds or paying any gas costs. Once an order gets accepted, the funds from the vault will be used, and other bids based on those funds will be automatically deleted. This concept allows buyers to place many different bids, even with a small amount of funds, without having to worry about gas fees or locking their funds for a long period. The virtual secure vault is based on the user's wallet security, and the same private key that ensures self-custody of the funds also ensures that the buyers' funds are kept safe and secure until they are needed for a transaction. 
 


Farming
The vaults are designed with built-in farming without any lock-in period required. Buyers who hold funds in their vaults will be incentivized by the Dumper Shield with APY rewards, which are paid out block by block, regularly, based on the amount of funds held in the vault. This feature encourages buyers to hold onto their funds and participate actively in the trading environment, creating a more stable and sustainable market for everyone involved.


Liquidity Gateway
The Liquidity Gateway system is designed to reduce the number of OTC orders by importing liquidity from the secondary market without negatively impacting the token's appreciation. 
To prevent excessive dumping, the Liquidity Gateway persistently monitors the previous day's token appreciation to determine the maximum limit on the number of tokens that can be sold during a given time period based on a dynamic appreciation limit. The goal of the Liquidity Gateway is to decrease the sell pressure from behind the dumper shield before the vesting period ends, while ensuring that the liquidity flowing into the OTC market does not reduce the token's last appreciation by more than 50%. This way, each day will have a small sell pressure while the token continues to appreciate.


Example 

Let's say the token's current price is $10 and it appreciates by 10% to $11. 
The Liquidity Gateway system determines that the maximum limit on the number of tokens that can be sold to the secondary market is 10,000 tokens, which would reduce the token value to $10.5.
The Liquidity Gateway system operates like a flash loan concept, buying the tokens from the users behind the dumper shield and selling them on the secondary market subject to the calculated limit amount.




ScalePad liquidity 
During the launch of their PDO offers, projects can choose to use some or all of their proceeds to buyback allocations from existing investors who are behind the Dumper Shield, using the Liquidity Gateway. This can provide an additional source of liquidity, helping to reduce sell pressure before the vesting period expires.


DAO Based
Users who are behind the dumper shield can vote to increase or decrease the remaining vesting time of the shield. There is a risk that once the Dumper Shield period concludes, there will be massive dumping, which can negatively impact the token value. To prevent this from happening, large investors are incentivized to extend the Dumper Shield, which enables them to engage with a safer amount of liquidity through the Gateway, up to a 50% depreciation limit, without destroying the token's value. Facing a 99.9% dump could result in significant losses, which is why daily access to liquidity and a reasonable depreciation limit is more appealing to large investors.

Security
The Dumper Shield is a hive of vaults secured by separate private keys. Each private key corresponds and belongs to the specific user’s wallet. The hive security method means no one has access to the vault besides the user’s wallet.
Dumper Shield Positions
The Dumper Shield consists of three levels of positions. These positions can be used to differentiate between investors and those who may earn the token through an airdrop or reward. Each position is prioritized above the positions below it when engaging with liquidity via the Gateway.


First position vs second position vs third position
The Dumper Shield comprises three classes of positions: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. The position determines the order in which liquidity from the Gateway is disbursed among the positions. Once there are no holders on the position above, the liquidity flows to the next position, all the way to the last.
While the first position may have a variable vesting period based on voting, the second and third positions have an infinite vesting period. Tokens always remain behind the Dumper Shield but are still available to engage with liquidity via the OTC and through the Gateway.
For example, Qwantum Finance Labs uses the first position to place investors who actually paid to purchase tokens, while the second position is used to place investors who teleport their positions from other Qwantum Finance Labs projects. The last position is used for placing users who receive tokens for free as rewards or airdrops. This order makes sense because users who receive free tokens may have different selling behavior than investors who bought the tokens.
That being said, each project can decide how to utilize these three positions according to their specific needs.


Dumper Shield Position Examples

1st position supply 10,000 tokens 
2nd position supply 5,000 tokens
3rd position supply 2,000 tokens 
Day 1 the gateway determines 6,000 worth of tokens are available
Day 2 the gateway determines additional 8,000 worth of tokens are available
Day 3 the gateway determines additional 1,000 worth of tokens are available
In day 1,  the 6,000 token liquidity available will be used to buyout orders in the 1st position. Ordres in 2nd and 3rd positions remain pending
In day 2,  the 9,000 token liquidity available will be used to buyout the remaining 2,000 orders in the 1st position, and the 5,000 tokens liquidity available leftover will be used to buyout the 5,000 orders in the 2st position. Ordres in 3rd positions remain pending.
In day 3,  the 1,000 token liquidity available will be used to buyout the partia of the  2,000 orders in the 3st position, and 1,000 orders on 3rd positions remain pending.
