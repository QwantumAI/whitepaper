VSinger and Metaverse 
Virtual singers can have an impact on the metaverse, which is a term used to describe a virtual universe where users can interact with each other and with digital objects and environments. Virtual singers can be used in the metaverse to create immersive experiences for users and to provide new forms of entertainment.
One way virtual singers can be used in the metaverse is as performers in virtual concerts or music festivals. Users can interact with virtual singers in real-time, creating a more immersive and engaging experience. Virtual singers can also be used in the metaverse to create interactive music videos, where users can interact with the virtual singer and the environment.
Additionally, virtual singers can be used in the metaverse as avatars to create virtual worlds, where users can interact with each other and with digital objects and environments in a more immersive way. This can be especially useful for people who want to escape the real world and explore new and exciting virtual worlds.
Overall, virtual singers are powerful tool and they becoming increasingly popular in the metaverse, with popular virtual singers such as Polar, ABBA, and Axel Merengue gaining millions of real-world followers. Vsinger is a unique form of entertainment that is allowing virtual performers to gain real-world recognition and fame.


Virtual idol
virtual idol who performs music and entertainment through the Metaverse. Vsinger is a term coined in China that refers to a virtual singer who performs in the virtual world, or Metaverse. These virtual singers are often created using 3D modeling and animation techniques, and they often interact with their fans using a variety of mediums such as live streaming, video, and audio. Vsinger is becoming increasingly popular in the music industry, and they are gaining more recognition and popularity with each passing day.


Virtual idol vs VTuber


Virtual idols and VTuber are both computer-generated characters that entertain viewers through performances, streaming games, and real-time interactions. The key difference between the two is that virtual idols are typically limited by the rules of idol culture and industry standards of cuteness and approachability, while VTuber don't have many restrictions and are allowed to express themselves more freely.


VSinger via NFT
Virtual singers can be used in conjunction with NFTs is by creating virtual singer NFTs. These could be digital collectibles that represent virtual singers, which can be bought, sold, and traded on blockchain marketplaces creating new revenue streams and opportunities for virtual singers.
These NFTs can include an array of information, such as the virtual singer's image, sound, and background information.
Another way virtual singers can be used in conjunction with NFTs is by creating NFTs that represent ownership of virtual singer's performances. These NFTs could be used to represent ownership of a virtual singer's performance in a virtual concert or music festival. This would allow fans to own a unique piece of the virtual singer's performance and could create scarcity and value for those NFTs.
Additionally, NFTs could be used to represent ownership of virtual singers' music video, giving fans the ability to own a unique, one-of-a-kind version of the video.










VSinger marketplace
There is not yet any marketplace specifically designed for socializing with Vsinger. Most marketplaces that sell Vsingers NFTs are part of larger NFT marketplaces, which do not offer the right environment to present the underlying assets and income streams, including merchandise or sub-collections.


Current NFT marketplaces 
The current market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is facing several challenges. One of these challenges is the need for a marketplace to trade NFTs, similar to eBay. However, these marketplaces can be vulnerable to fraud and low volume, which can hinder liquidity. In addition, there is the risk of scammers manipulating the market by using multiple wallets and transactions to artificially inflate the price of their own NFTs and then selling them to unsuspecting buyers at a premium. This can erode community trust and decrease speculation and buying.
Even if a marketplace is free of fraud and scams, it is still likely to face other issues. P2P galleries, like OpenSea, may become overcrowded and resemble stock photo sites or app stores with a vast number of offerings. This could make it difficult for creators and investors to sell their Vsingers or Vsinger collections, as they may struggle to gain the visibility and promotion needed to succeed. The market may become dominated by a small number of influencers or celebrities who are able to generate the necessary hype to sell their Vsingers.
It's worth mentioning that many Vsingers are under agencies, who in most cases own the rights of the character, the story and the IP behind it, they are the ones who should provide a legal license to use the character and its associated rights.


Needs for a better Vsinger marketplace 
There is a need for a better Vsinger marketplace that addresses several issues currently facing the market. One of these issues is the need to generate sustainable liquidity for sellers, regardless of market conditions. This means that sellers should be able to easily buy and sell their Vsingers even when the market is experiencing downturns or volatility.
Another need is to create a marketplace that provides equal opportunity for all sellers, regardless of their level of promotion or recognition. This includes providing opportunities for new and unknown creators to sell their Vsingers and generate income streams from their intellectual property.
The marketplace should also work to eliminate scams and pump and dump schemes, which can manipulate the market and harm honest sellers and buyers. By providing a safe and transparent marketplace, it will be possible to increase confidence and trust in the market, which can in turn drive increased liquidity and buying pressure.
Vsinger.exchange is an NFT decentrlzed exchange that aims to address all the challenges facing the market, including the need for sustainable liquidity, buy pressure, and the removal of pump and dump schemes. It does this by using quantum finance models to create the world's first NFT based on 100% liquidity protection through techniques such as Reverse Market Making, Decentralized Venture Capital, and IP income stream generation.
Unlike other NFT marketplaces, which are often centralized and built as peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, Vsinger.exchange is the world's first decentralized NFT exchange to support both peer-to-contract (P2C) and contract-to-contract (C2C) transactions. This decentralized approach is meant to provide additional security and transparency for buyers and sellers.


Quantum Finance
Quantum finance is a new field that uses theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists to solve problems in finance. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe how particles behave at the atomic and subatomic level. Unlike traditional binary methods, which are based on two positions (0 and 1, false and true) and often result in a zero-sum game with high risk and limited possibilities, quantum finance introduces multiple positions that can significantly reduce risk and create liquidity even for non-liquid assets.
The Vsinger.exchange applies quantum finance principles in a way that allows investors to simultaneously hold two contradictory positions: one as a buyer and owner of a Vsinger, and another as a non-buyer and non-owner. This allows investors to potentially profit from their investments and then decide whether to finalize the transaction as a buyer or walk away, depending on how the market develops or the Vsinger's success becomes.


Although quantum finance is a relatively new field, the team behind Vsinger.exchange believes that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about finance and investment. They are proud to be among the first to bring this concept to the blockchain.


Reverse Market Making (RMM)
Reverse Market Making (RMM) is a liquidity solution that was designed to boost the non-fungible token (NFT) industry in a similar way to how Automated Market Making (AMM) has helped the cryptocurrency market during the 2019 bullrun. AMM has been used by decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap to provide liquidity to brand new projects from the start, without the barriers of traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs). It has also paved the way for the development of new lending, options, and derivative protocols, which are now an important part of the decentralized financial ecosystem.
RMM works by creating instant liquidity for any Vsinger through a smart contract, without the need for a counterparty buyer. It allows buyers to reverse their trade back to the smart contract like it was a refund or cancellation order, while the seller acts as the market maker and benefits from the trade-off regardless of the outcome. This liquidity solution provides protection for buyers during the period of liquidity protection.


100% Liquidity protection
Vsingera and Vsinger collections can be difficult to trade due to scalability issues, limited liquidity, and higher risks for investors. These risks are exacerbated by bad actors who promote assets through manipulating their value and demand using fake wallets, and the lack of a guarantee of liquidity for sellers.
To address these issues, Vsinger.exchange designed 100% liquidity protection solution for buyers. This means that sellers can act as market makers by offering buyers protection for a certain period of time, during which buyers have the option to return the Vsinger to the smart contract and receive back the exact protected value in the same tokens that they invested with. This protection is available regardless of market conditions, helping to reduce risk for buyers and make it easier for them to trade Vsingers.[1]


example 
Bob seeks to sell his Vsinger for $1,000 while simultaneously earning a reward for acting as a market maker for future buyers. He employs Reverse Market Making (RMM) to provide the future buyer with complete liquidity protection for 90 days, in exchange for a 5% slippage fee in case of cancellation. This ensures that even in the event of a cancelled sale, Bob still earns a 5% profit over 90 days, equating to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY).
 
Lisa decides to purchase Bob's Vsinger for $1,000 and transfers her funds to a Liquidity Protection smart contract acting as a safeguard. If Lisa finalizes the transaction, she will only have to pay the base price of $1,000 to Bob. However, if market conditions deteriorate or if Lisa is unable to resell the Vsinger, she has the option to reverse the transaction and receive a full refund of her funds, minus any applicable fees and slippage.




Earning from making the market
Sellers who act as market makers utlzing the RMM have the opportunity to earn rewards in two ways: through slippage and by leveraging staking.
Slippage reward
Slippage reward is a form of compensation that sellers can request in exchange for offering a liquidity protection period. The amount of slippage is disclosed to and agreed upon by the buyer before the transaction takes place, and it is fixed rather than being unpredictable like it is on some decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Leveraging staking 
Alternatively or in addition to slippage, sellers can offer buyers low or even zero slippage in exchange for the opportunity to leverage the buyer's funds on a third-party decentralized protocol to generate passive income through annual percentage yield (APY). This can reduce the cost for the buyer to zero and provide the seller with enough reward to justify acting as a market maker. In both cases, the initial principal from the purchase is secured in a smart contract vault and is not sent to the seller until the sale is finalized.[2]
Benefits for sellers and buyers utilizing RMM
There are several benefits for both sellers and buyers to utlize RMM solution. Sellers can potentially increase their conversion rate and provide equal opportunities to new and unknown Vsinger creators by offering liquidity protection. They can also earn rewards as market makers regardless of the sale outcome, and if they choose to leverage staking, they can keep any APY staking rewards earned. This earning while selling concept is similar to a traditional lease-to-own concept in the real estate industry.
Buyers, on the other hand, can hedge their investments and explore higher-risk and potentially lucrative new opportunities with the knowing that they can always reverse the trade back to the smart contract like it was a cancellation or refund without any tax triggers if they are unable to sell the Vsinger to a new buyer. If a buyer agrees to a slippage reward, they will only pay it if they cancel the transaction and receive a full refund. If the seller is leveraging staking, the buyer does not have to pay anything in exchange for the liquidity protection; instead, the seller is paid by a third-party decentralized staking protocol such as Curve, Venus, or Yearn Finance.




Comparing example for seller
OpenSea peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace
Bob represent an agency that has 100 Vsingers for sale at $10,000 each, totaling $1,000,000. Bob lists the Vsingers on OpenSea and has a 5% conversion sale rate, meaning he receives $50,000 for selling his Vsingers, while the remaining $950,000 worth of Vsinger do not sell.


VSX peer-to-contract (P2C) decentrlzed exchange 
Bob use P2C to sell his 100 Vsingers at a sale of $10,000 each, totaling $1,000,000. Bob lists his Vsingers with liquidity protection for 365 days, and while his Vsingers are under liquidity protection, he has a 95% cancellation rate (meaning the actual sale rate is only 5%, like on OpenSea). Bob receives $50,000 for selling his Vsingers, plus an additional $95,000 from generating 10% slippage or APY over the $950,000 worth of Vsingers that did not sell. This means Bob's total reward is 290% more than on a peer-to-peer marketplace like OpenSea.


Comparing example for buyer
OpenSea - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 
-          Lisa purchased Vsinger for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her Vsinger and she left with zero sum game. Meaning the
Vsinger has no value.
VSX  - Peer-to-Contract  (P2C)
-          Lisa purchased Vsinger for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her Vsinger so she return it back to the liquidity protection smart 
contract and get a full 100% refund (minus Vsinger,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee and pre agreed slippage if exist) if Lisa agreed to liquidity leverage instead of slippage reward, then lisa will get all her investment back fully (minus Vsinger,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee)




Liquidity protection process
The liquidity protection process is a way for sellers to offer buyers protection against potential losses that may occur when buying and selling assets. The process involves the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the protection offered to buyers.
Step 1 - Offering
sellers offer buyers 100% liquidity protection for a specified number of days, and select a reward for the protection based on slippage or leverage staking.


Step 2 - Selection
buyers can select an Vsinger that provides the desired liquidity protection and reward.


Step 3 - Sale and protection period
the slippage reward is sent to the seller immediately and is non-refundable. The funds covered by the liquidity protection are locked in a smart contract and, if the seller has offered liquidity protection with leverage staking, are also transferred to decentralized protocols like yearn.finance or Venus to generate passive annual percentage yield (APY) as a reward for the seller.


Step 4 - Buyer revokes Liquidity protection
buyers have the option to revoke the liquidity protection by returning the Vsinger to the seller's liquidity protection smart contract. This triggers a full refund of the protected funds in the original token used by the buyer. If the transaction included leverage staking, the seller will receive the APY market making rewards and the buyer will receive their protected funds from the decentralized protocols in the form of a wrapped token (such as cUSDC or vUSDC).
Alternatively, if the Vsinger is not returned to the liquidity protection contract during the protection period, the seller can claim payment from the smart contract once the period expires, indicating a successful sell.
Seller use case 
-       Imagine a seller of 100 different Vsingers
-       The seller offers all 100 Vsingers for $10,000 each (worth $1,000,000 total)
Thos Vsinger are protected by liquidity protection in exchange for leveraging staking or fix slippage
-       Once received, the $1,000,000 received by the contract, it is automatically sent to Venus and/or yearn.finance with an average 10% APY or stay in the vault in exchange for immediate fixed slippage of let’s say 10%
-       During the protection period 95% of the Vsingers are canceled and 5% are sold
-       For the 5% Vsingers sold, the seller receives the full payment of $50K and the buyer receives back the Vsinger’s
-       The funds for the remaining 95% of the Vsinger’s that were canceled are returned to the buyer and the Vsingers to the seller.
-       During this period, the seller generated APY above the $1,000,000 value of the Vsingers, equal to $100,000
-       The total profit for the seller is $150,000 ($50,000 for the sold Vsingers + $100,000 reward) representing 300% ROI over 50K sold Vsinger supply.
Unlimited liquidity protection layers
RMM designed to increase liquidity and demand for Vsingers in the same way that the Bill of Exchange, a financial instrument from the 17th century, increased liquidity for money. When a buyer purchases an Vsinger with liquidity protection via RMM, the protection acts as collateral for the buyer. This means that the buyer can then sell the same Vsinger to another buyer with liquidity protection, potentially at a higher price, and earn a profit. This process can be repeated multiple times, with the Vsinger being resold to successive buyers with liquidity protection, potentially resulting in increased trading volume and value for the Vsinger . The number of times the Vsinger can be resold in this way is unlimited.


Incentives for buyers to create a buy pressure 
There are several incentives for buyers to create buying pressure for Vsingers via RMM (Reserve Market Making) and retain or resell them in the future, such as:
1. Buyers can register themselves as future owners under the multilevel ownership, even if they bought and sold the Vsingers at a higher, same, or lower price.
2. Buyers can earn market-making rewards that are larger than the rewards they pay to their sellers.
3. Buyers can at any time fork their Vsingers and create derivatives or sub-collections, and then conduct an initial offering, but  they  can only claim the profits generated from these sales once their liquidity protection period has expired, as an alternative they can also sell the NFT along with underlying locked profits from the sub-collections to the next buyer.


Example of cancellation 
Bob purchases an Vsingers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage.


Lisa then purchases the same Vsingers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


Mitch then purchases the Vsingers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


After 30 days, Mitch decides to cancel the purchase and gets back his $40,000 minus slippage. The Vsingers is returned to Lisa, which automatically triggers her liquidity protection to return it to Bob and compensate her with $20,000 minus the slippage. Once Bob receives the Vsingers, his liquidity protection is also triggered, returning it to the creator and compensate Bob with $10,000 minus the slippage.


In this scenario, none of the buyers in the liquidity protection layers are exposed to any principal loss. At the same time, each buyer who acts as a seller is rewarded as a market-making via slippage compensation, including the creator.






Example of completion
Bob purchases an Vsingers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage.


Lisa then purchases the same Vsingers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


Mitch then purchases the Vsingers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


After 60 days have passed, the liquidity protection for Mitch has expired. As a result, Mitch retains the Vsingers and all the sellers, including the creator, can claim their sales profits from the smart contract.


Regular P2P sales are FREE
In addition to the innovative solutions offered by Vsingers.exchange, it also enables users to conduct standard peer-to-peer transactions (without liquidity protection) that are offered by other NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Uniswap, and others, at no charge and with 0% fees.


Expending P2C liquidity protection to P2P marketplaces
Vsingers that have been protected via RMM can be also sold on peer-to-peer (P2P) basic marketplaces such as Opensea and SuperRare.
The liquidity protection feature remains linked to the Vsinger even after it is sold, so that future buyers on other platforms can return the Vsinger to the liquidity protection smart contract on VTube.exhange. This allows for the Vsinger to continue being protected even if it is resold multiple times on different platforms.


The future of digital venders 
In the future, digital vendors that offer a 30-90 days refund policy “100% money back guarantee” no questions asked, may adopt the liquidity protection to ensure the security of their refund policies. With liquidity protection, buyers can trust any vendor, even if the vendor becomes insolvent, because the money they use to purchase a digital product is deposited into a secure smart contract vault. If the buyer decides to return the product during the protection period, they can use a decentralized trigger to call the money back from the smart contract vault. This allows for a hassle-free refund process with minimal risk for both the buyer and the vendor.
Derivatives subcollection
VTube.exhange's AI technology allows Vsinger owners to create and sell derivative subcollections as new Vsingers through an initial offering. These new Vsingers can have unique terms set by the seller, such as value and liquidity protection. This solution allows buyers to generate additional income streams that may exceed the cost of the original Vsinger. The income from the initial offering and rewards from the derivative subcollection are linked to the original Vsinger and are locked until the original Vsinger is no longer under liquidity protection. This model can incentivize buyers to hold onto the Vsinger until the liquidity protection expires or sell it at a premium price with the included subcollection assets and locked value.


Fixed sale or auction
Vsinger.exchange offers fixed sale and auction options for Vsingers. Both of these options allow for the inclusion of liquidity protection and automated syndication contracts.


Automated Decentralized Syndication 
Vsinger.exchange's Automated Decentralized Syndication (ADS) allows any buyer or seller to pool funds together to purchase an Vsinger and automatically resell it for a profit. ADS acts as the owner of the Vsinger and each ADS can only be used for one Vsinger. All members of the ADS have an equal share based on their investment amount, and can claim their profits or refunded principal at any time without authorization from other investors. ADS provides is a security compliant, efficient, and scalable solution for group purchasing of Vsingers, avoiding the security risks and potential deadlock of tokenized tokens that can occur with other syndication models.


Decentralized Venture Capital
Decentralized Venture Capital (DVC) is a fund with a potential no loss strategy[3]  that utilizes contract-to-contract (C2C) interactions and targets investment opportunities based on specific criteria, such as liquidity protection and specific collections. The DVC can be created by deploying funds or by acting as a General Partner (GP) and inviting Limited Partners (LPs) to contribute funds. The investment criteria for the DVC is set by the creator and automatically triggers the buying and selling of Vsingers based on these criteria. The DVC creator, similar to a GP, has the option to charge a carry or success fee from the profits of their LPs[4]. DVCs are incentivized to add value to their portfolio through marketing, promotion, or by adding IP to the Vsinger, rather than waiting for market forces to increase the value of the Vsinger

Multilevel ownership
The multilevel ownership contract allows sellers to continue earning passive income from the sale of their assets even after the asset has been resold multiple times. This means that the asset will continue to generate profits for its previous owners. The income from each new sale is split proportionally among all current owners in real-time. This solution is fully decentralized and works even if the asset is listed and sold on exchanges that do not support this model.
Transaction fee 
When a purchase is made on VTube.exhange, a 2.5% transaction fee is immediately applied. After the fee is applied, the seller will receive the remaining amount once the transaction is no longer under protection. If the seller charges a slippage fee, it will be calculated based on the remaining amount after the VTube.exhange transaction fee. For example, if the sale price is $100, the seller will be eligible for $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, they will receive $9.75 immediately, and the remaining $87.75 will be locked under the liquidity protection contract. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VSX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the seller.


Cancelation fee
If a buyer returns an Vsingerto the liquidity protection contract, the sale fee that was originally paid by the seller becomes a cancellation fee that is paid by the buyer. For example, if the sale price is $100 and the VTube.exhange fee is 2.5%, the buyer's liquidity protection will be $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, the buyer will receive a refund of $87.75. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VSX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the buyer.
