SmartExchange is a layer zero cross chain based on decentralized bridges that validate by  unlimited validators decentralized community. 


SmartExchange is a decentralized organization managed by a DAO community and created by Qonetum Finance early 2017. The first published pending patent was in 2018 when there was no DeFi awareness. At this time, investors did not even know what slippage was so the solution pre-dated the problem. Now, with the emergence of AMMs and abundance of cross-chain hacks, Smart.Exchange solves a known need in the industry.

SmartExtension
SmartExtension simplifies the process of accessing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and provides users with a seamless experience. With SmartExtension installed, users can easily connect their wallets to DeFi platforms like decentralized exchanges (DEX) and take advantage of the alternative and lucrative offers and prices that are displayed. The extension is designed to trigger these offers and prices automatically, so users don't have to spend time searching for the best deals. This makes it an indispensable tool for anyone interested in utilizing DeFi platforms and maximizing their returns.
SmartExtension is also user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that makes it easy for even novice users to navigate. The extension is customizable, allowing users to adjust the settings and preferences to their liking. This makes it possible for users to optimize their DeFi experience according to their individual needs and goals. With SmartExtension, users can stay on top of the rapidly evolving DeFi market and make informed decisions with ease.








The SmartExtension can also be utilized to connect to web2 platforms, such as Twitter, and transform them into web3 platforms. This enables users to participate in initial bond offerings (IBO) or sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on these platforms without having to leave the platform

SmartPayment
SmartPayment is a PayPal-like solution designed to enable users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on different blockchains without the need to exchange their native tokens for the foreign blockchain's native token. This means that users can pay with any digital asset they have, such as cryptocurrency, NFTs, or digital government money, while the dApp recipient receives the currency they require and request. For instance, the SmartPayment solution allows users who hold ETH to use ETH to support projects on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and these projects can receive BNB instead of ETH.
The SmartPayment solution eliminates the limitations faced by projects that want to host their contract on a specific blockchain while still taking advantage of the benefits offered by more popular chains. This helps to create a more inclusive and accessible ecosystem for dApps and users alike.

SmartWallet
The SmartWallet solution transforms any wallet into an interoperable payment platform instantly. With SmartWallet, users can make payments using any token, while the recipient can receive their preferred token without any additional steps. This provides a seamless and convenient payment experience for both parties.

SMART Bridge
The SmartBridge solution enables the creation of a decentralized, cross-chain bridge for any token, such as SoulBounds or decentralized social media, in a matter of seconds. This cutting-edge technology is accessible to any projects and their users, providing a seamless and efficient way to connect different blockchain networks and facilitate the exchange of tokens. The SmartBridge solution helps to break down barriers between different blockchain networks and promote greater interoperability and collaboration within the decentralized ecosystem


The owner of the token can assume control over the bridge that has been created through the use of a smart contract, becoming the master validator for the bridge. This means that no transactions will occur without the project's approval. In other words, instead of relying on third-party validators, the project has the power to control and act as the master validator for its own token bridge, in addition to the validators provided by other projects in the community

SmartSwap
SmartSwap is a decentralized exchange that provides multichain swaps with a one-click and slippage-free experience. It acts as a decentralized layer ZERO with access to liquidity from all market participants, including centralized exchanges and OTC traders.


SmartSwap uses a zero volatility patent pending method that prevents slippage and reimburses users for fees and gas costs. Instead of choosing the value of a token, users choose the USD face value of the tokens they want to swap, and the exchange prices the tokens based on the average market price. 


SmartSwap also allows for one-click cross-chain swaps between different blockchain networks, without a single point of failure. Currently, SmartSwap supports swaps between BNB, ETH, and Matic, and has the ability to work with any EVM blockchain.

Transaction fee 
Fees are incurred for successful swaps on Smart exchange products. The total fee for smartswap  is 0.30% , smart extenstion is 0.1% , smart wallet 0.1% , smart Bridge 0%


All fees can be changed via voting bt the $SMART DAO community.
The $SMART fees are reimbursed in $SMART tokens through the reimbursement staking  csmart ontract, eliminating any costs for the seller.
Use of fees breakdown
The fees generated from $SMART are used as follows: 80% is used to buy $SMART tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the $SMART technology and to support the project.
100% fee reimbursement
$SMART users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of $SMART tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 
For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the $SMART tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.
Tokenomics
Digital Royalty Token
The $SMART tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens instruments tied and correlated to the business performance of the $SMART project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy $SMART digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining $SMART digital royalty tokens.

Pre-mint
The $SMART digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.


Total pre-mint:                                 3,812,290,000[1]




$SMART price
Baseline Pre-sale via SAFT:                 $0.01 
Baseline Public sale via IBO:                $0.01
Listing price:                                 $0.02


Post minting
After the initial minting, $SMART tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement $SMART contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.




Future split
Since $SMART has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case, the DAO may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of $SMART tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallets would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy $SMART and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 $SMART with a face value of $1000. The investor’s total holdings equal $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. $SMART announces a split
3. $SMART splits and distributes, to $SMART holders, $SMART proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 NFTmx, still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
