LAYER 2 VIRTUAL WALLET 












Overview
SmartExchange is a web3 advanced platform that acts as a layer 2 virtual wallet, utilizing the established security of decentralized wallets like MetaMask and TrustWallet.
SmartExchange's primary purpose is to allow users to optimize their multi-chain and cross-chain transactions, improving speed, cost, and risk mitigation.
Additionally, SmartExchange offers virtual wallet holders the opportunity to generate passive income through its Arbitrage system and through its advanced AI Quantum market-making system.


SmartExchange is a decentralized organization established by Qwantum Finance Labs and governed by a DAO community. In the early years, when cross chain solutions weren't not yet available, SmartExchange took on the challenge of creating the world's first decentralized cross-chain solution called SmartSwap. This groundbreaking platform enabled one-click cross-chain transactions between native tokens to native tokens on networks such as ETH, BNB, and Polygon.
However, as other cross-chain platforms with centralized code moved faster and gained popularity, the decentralized advantage of SmartSwap became meaningless. Users prioritize speed and low costs over decentralization, even after experiencing billions of dollars in losses due to hacking events.


Recognizing this reality, SmartSwap made a strategic pivot in its focus. Instead of solely improving its own decentralized cross-chain platform, the project aims to pioneer an umbrella infrastructure with a core solution that seeks to mitigate slippage and enhance liquidity for all existing multi-chain and cross-chain platforms. This approach aims to provide a more robust and efficient experience for all users.


Why is the current cross chains has time delay ?
Due to the growing number of blockchain ecosystems and cross-chain transactions, delays can occur as a result of measures taken to avoid 51% attacks and synchronize validators. This is especially noticeable when bridging transactions between different code language platforms like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Cosmos, and others, which can further extend waiting times.
Why is the current DeFi P2P solution not working well?
The main problem with the current peer-to-peer trading among users is that often these orders not only remain pending while waiting for a counterparty, but even when a counterparty is found, there may be remaining supply that remains pending due to the unlikelihood of a perfect match. This predicament creates a catch-22 situation, as traders are hesitant to be the first to place an order. Also, if an order has leftovers, that means itâ€™s need to be matched with multiple counterparties, resulting in additional gas costs. This undermines the cost-effectiveness of the entire decentralized P2P concept and restricts the participation of market makers as seen in centralized exchanges.


The future of defi

We predict that multi-chain and cross-chain digital assets, including future CBDCs, digital stocks, and other new assets, will dominate the future trading landscape, eventually offering fast P2P transactions without slippage.
To lay the groundwork for this possibility, we have designed SmartExchange to become the first virtual wallet infrastructure umbrella for arbitrage and market markers network, aiming to improve Defi protocols slippage and speed.


Virtual wallets 
Self-custody holding 
Smart Exchange users can store their funds in vaults protected by the user's wallet security, using the same private key that ensures self-custody of the funds.
Self-custody market maker 
Smart Exchange's virtual wallets are specifically designed to function as a self-custody market-making solution. With these wallets, users can place an unlimited number of Funtom swap orders across various markets without the need to spend gas or lock any funds beforehand. This innovative approach not only enables market makers to maximize their profits when compared to other alternatives but also significantly reduces the swap costs for SmartExchange users in comparison to AMM pools.

Self-custody Arbitrage
Smart Exchange's virtual wallets function automatically as a short-term arbitrage system, offering swift solutions for cross-chain users.

Self-custody rewards 
Users who hold their preferred type of tokens in their virtual wallets are automatically rewarded with the same tokens when the arbitrage system generates profits from expedited orders. There is no need to lock or stack any funds, and users have the ability to withdraw at any time.




Arbitrage Solution for Expedited Speed
SmartExchange serves as an intermediary smart contract for cross-chain swaps, facilitating expedited order processing while mitigating exposure risks associated with cross-chain protocols. 
When users initiate cross-chain swap orders through SmartExchange, their funds are directed to a third-party cross-chain protocol. However, users instantly receive the destination tokens from the arbitrage system within seconds, while the original tokens that were expected from the third-party protocol are returned to the virtual wallet community.
This arbitrage solution allows the virtual wallet community to temporarily lend tokens to cross-chain users for a few minutes in exchange for receiving the same type of tokens back, along with additional expedite fees. The entire arbitrage process occurs automatically without requiring any action from anyone.Even if a specific virtual wallet's funds haven't been used for a particular expedited order, that wallet will still be rewarded pro rata from the expedite fee simply because it is holding the same token.

Example 
Bob wants to expedite a cross chain swap 1 ETH (Ethereum) for 150 MATIC (Polygon) using SmartExchange.
Bob sends his 1 ETH to SmartExchange's intermediate smart contract.
SmartExchange's intermediate smart contract sends slightly less than 150 MATIC to account for the fee, so Bob receives slightly less than 150 MATIC.
The SmartExchange's intermediate smart contract then sends the 1 ETH directly to the third-party cross-chain provider along with the SmartExchange's intermediate smart contract address as the receiver of the 150 MATIC.
After the waiting time is over and the 3rd party cross-chain finishes the process of the original transaction, the SmartExchange's intermediate smart contract receives the full 150 MATIC tokens directly from the third-party cross-chain provider.
The extra MATIC profits from the expedite is distributed as reward prorata between all the virtual wallets that hold MATIC.


Native token instead of wrap token
Many cross-chain exchanges offer wrapped tokens on the destination chain instead of native tokens. which typically requires the receiver to perform an additional swap or to unwrap the token However, by using an expedited order via SwapExchange, users can receive the end token directly, saving the time and effort required for an extra swap. The SmartExchange contract takes care of the second swap automatically on the destination chain and delivers the tokens back to the virtual wallet community.



1-Click Cross-Chain 
SmartExchange enables seamless cross-chain token swaps with just one click. The intermediate contract of SmartExchange seamlessly interacts with cross-chain smart contracts to deliver the final tokens directly to the user's original wallet on the destination chain. In the case of non-EVM to EVM swaps, users may need to specify the receiving wallet for the destination chain during the initial order.



Risk disclosure 
SmartExchange acts as a layer on top of different third-party cross-chain providers. Some providers are decentralized and offer better security, while others have centralized features that make them more vulnerable to attacks. During an expedited transaction, virtual wallet holders take the risk of the third-party cross-chain provider being hacked while waiting for airbrage transaction to be completed. This can lead to delays or even a total loss of the transaction, especially if the cross-chain provider goes out of operation with no chance of recovery.


Market Maker Solution for Cheaper Swaps

The virtual wallet is designed as a market-making tool, allowing for the placement of unlimited quantum limit orders without the need to move or lock any funds, or pay any gas costs. Additionally, the virtual wallet supports matching one-to-many orders without incurring any extra gas expenses. 
By placing simultaneous unlimited orders across multiple markets and decentralized exchanges, the virtual wallet can capture various opportunities and generate a high ROI that can be more cost-effective than centralized exchanges.
Such a solution benefits not only the holders of virtual wallets but also enables an efficient decentralized P2P network, which is crucial for reducing the costs associated with swap slippage often seen in current AMMs.



Uniswap V3 
Uniswap made a significant protocol change by transitioning from an AMM model to a decentralized order book limit order style. This update allows market makers to choose the specific range where they want to deploy their funds, resulting in reduced slippage for users and minimizing losses for the market makers. However, this change requires market makers to actively monitor the market and adjust their limit orders when the token price moves outside of the chosen range.


AI-Driven Market Maker
SmartExchange provides an advanced AI tool for passive managing market maker trades across a wide range of tokens. This tool optimizes the buying and selling ranges to maximize the return on investment. For example, a market maker can choose to trade with 1, 5, 10, or even more types of tokens. The AI system is capable of dynamically adjusting the limit buy and sell orders based on real-time data, ensuring that market makers can maximize their profits effectively.

User experience 
SmartExchange functions as both a smartphone app and a web browser extension, serving as a comprehensive platform for users to engage with various blockchain opportunities.
When a user is ready to conduct a transaction on a DeFi protocol, SmartExchange identifies and captures the transaction, providing alternative options that are faster or more cost-effective.


Alternative offers
When users connect their wallets to DeFi platforms, such as DEXs , SmartExchange is triggered and presents the user with alternative and profitable offers. Users have the option to choose between faster expedited transactions or more cost-effective opportunities available in P2P or P2DEX. 


One-Stop Shop
SmartExchange offers a user-friendly web3-based interface that is easily navigable, even for new users. The platform is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust settings and preferences according to their preferences. This level of customization enables users to optimize their DeFi experience based on their individual needs and goals.
Additionally, SmartExchange provides shortcuts to favorite links, alerts, and various opportunities such as launch-pads, scale-pads, NFTs, staking, airdrops, strategy analysis, index tracking, educational, portfolio tracking, and access for all crypto apps from the google play marketplace.



Transaction fee 
Fees are incurred for successful swaps on SmartExchange products. The total fee for a swap is 0.30%, and for expedited swaps, it's 0.3%.
All fees can be changed through voting by the $SMART DAO community.
The $SMART fees are reimbursed in $SMART tokens via the reimbursement staking contract, eliminating any costs for the seller.

100% fee reimbursement
$SMART users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of $SMART tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one-year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later.

For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the $SMART tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the selling pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.

Use of fees breakdown
Swap fees are used as follows: 80% is used to buyback $SMART tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the SmartExcange technology and to support the project.

Expedite fees are allocated as follows: 80% is distributed pro rata among the virtual wallet holders, while 20% is designated for Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the SmartExchange technology and to support the project.

The spread resulting from market making belongs 100% to the virtual wallet that executes the market making order.


Free Stablecoin cross chain 
To increase popularity, SmartExchange will leverage the virtual wallet network to offer users the ability to swap any P2P cross-chain stablecoin with zero slippage and zero fees. Virtual wallet holders will still be compensated for this free service through dVoucher rewards.
