What is VTuber?
A VTuber (short for "virtual YouTuber") is a type of online content creator who uses a virtual avatars to interact with their audience, typically through video streaming or pre-recorded videos on platforms like YouTube or Twitch. The avatar can take many forms, but is often that of an anime-style character or other fantastical creature. The person behind the avatar may or may not reveal their true identity to the audience, but the avatar allows them to perform as a distinct character with a unique personality and backstory. Some VTubers also use motion capture technology to create a more realistic and lifelike avatar.


  

 VTubers are the future of YouTube 
The potential developments that could shape the future of VTubers include:
1. Continued growth in popularity: VTubers have gained a significant following in recent years, particularly in Japan and Asia. As more people discover and become interested in VTubers, their popularity is likely to continue to grow.
2. Greater use of advanced technology: As technology continues to advance, VTubers may begin to use more realistic and expressive avatars, or even fully-realized virtual reality environments. This could lead to a more immersive and engaging experience for viewers.
3. More diverse representation: Currently, the majority of VTubers are animated characters, with a majority of them being anime-style girls. In the future, it is possible that we may see more diverse representation, with VTubers of different races, genders, and other characteristics.
4. Increased monetization: As VTubers continue to gain popularity, it is likely that there will be more opportunities for them to monetize their content and make a living from creating it.
5. More interactivity and engagement with fans: There are already some VTubers that use livestreaming to interact with fans in real-time, and some games have been developed for VTubers like Hololive which have shows where they interact with fans using voice chat. The trend is increasing.
It's hard to predict with certainty how things will evolve, but it's likely that VTubers will continue to be an important part of the online entertainment landscape, as they provide a unique form of content and a way for creators to connect with their audience in a new and interesting way. 






How VTubers make money? 
VTubers make money through a variety of methods, such as:
6. Advertising revenue: VTubers can monetize their videos through ads, either by placing them in the video itself or through overlays on the video.
7. Sponsorships and collaborations: VTubers can work with brands to promote products or services in their videos or livestreams. Some VTubers also collaborate with other VTubers or online creators to create content together, which can be sponsored.
8. Subscriptions and memberships: Many VTubers offer exclusive content or perks to viewers who subscribe to their channel or become members. Some platforms like YouTube and Twitch also have a built-in membership program for channels.
9. Merchandising: VTubers often sell merchandise, such as clothing, accessories, or figures related to their character.
10. Virtual goods sales: Some VTubers develop virtual items like stickers, emotes and backgrounds to be used in their livestreams or during interaction with fans.
11. Donations: VTubers can also make money through donations from their fans. Platforms like Twitch and YouTube have built-in donation systems, and some VTubers also use third-party platforms like Patreon or Ko-fi to receive support.
It's worth mentioning that VTubers like traditional influencers usually are a part of a agency, so they have to share a percentage of the money they make with the agency as they are responsible for a lot of things like video production, technical assistance, management, and promotion.


VTuber market potential 
The VTubers industry is still relatively new and is primarily based in Japan and Asia, but is gaining popularity globally. The size of the VTubers industry is difficult to quantify, but it is currently in a rapid growth phase and has attracted a large and dedicated following in a relatively short amount of time.
According to a report by the Japanese news agency, Kyodo News, the global Vtuber (Virtual YouTuber) market size was valued at USD 2188.32 million in 2022 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 35.03 percentage during the forecast period, reaching USD 13265.26 million by 2028. Not includes income from livestreaming, advertising, merchandise sales and more.
The most popular VTubers have millions of followers across multiple platforms and have achieved mainstream success in Japan. Many have appeared in television commercials, music videos, and other forms of media. Some VTubers have also made live appearances at events and conventions.
The industry is also expanding globally, with the increasing number of VTubers from countries outside of Japan, and there are a lot of agencies created to support the new creator and provide services for them. It is also believed that the VTubers industry will continue to grow in the future, as more creators enter the space and technology continues to improve, allowing for more realistic and expressive avatars.

VTuber and Metaverse 
The metaverse is an emerging concept that refers to a virtual shared space where users can interact and engage with each other, as well as with virtual objects and environments. VTubers, with their ability to be interactive, entertaining, and personal, can potentially play an important role in the metaverse.
One way VTubers could be relevant in the metaverse is by providing a personal and relatable presence for users to interact with. VTubers can be designed to have a wide range of personalities, emotions, and characteristics, which makes them more human-like, This can make the interactions with them more engaging and personal, which can make the experience in the metaverse more immersive.
Another way is by providing content for the metaverse. VTubers can create and perform live shows, interactive games, and other forms of entertainment that can be experienced by users in the metaverse, This can also be a source of revenue for VTubers, as they can be paid for their performances, and even merchandise sales.
VTubers can also be utilized as avatars, representing users in the metaverse, they could also be used to access different experiences and areas of the metaverse, such as virtual events, shopping centers, and educational areas, and allowing users to interact with the environment and other users through the VTubers' avatars.
It's worth mentioning that the metaverse is still in early stages of development, it's hard to predict how it will look like in the future and how much of it will be adopted by users, as well as which kind of experiences and functionalities will be included in it. But it's clear that VTubers can provide a unique and engaging experiences for users and a new source of income for creators.


VTuber via NFT
VTuber account or rights to use the character could be represented as an NFT (non-fungible token) and  sold or transferred to another user on an individual basis. An NFT of a VTuber would typically consist of a digital file that represents the VTuber's avatar, along with metadata such as the VTuber's name and backstory. The buyer of the NFT would own the digital rights to the VTuber, such as using the character for personal or commercial purposes, and also could sell it again in the future if they want to.




VTuber marketplace
There is not yet any marketplace specifically designed for socializing with VTubers. Most marketplaces that sell VTubers NFTs are part of larger NFT marketplaces, which do not offer the right environment to present the underlying assets and income streams, including merchandise or sub-collections.


Current NFT marketplaces 
The current market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is facing several challenges. One of these challenges is the need for a marketplace to trade NFTs, similar to eBay. However, these marketplaces can be vulnerable to fraud and low volume, which can hinder liquidity. In addition, there is the risk of scammers manipulating the market by using multiple wallets and transactions to artificially inflate the price of their own NFTs and then selling them to unsuspecting buyers at a premium. This can erode community trust and decrease speculation and buying.
Even if a marketplace is free of fraud and scams, it is still likely to face other issues. P2P galleries, like OpenSea, may become overcrowded and resemble stock photo sites or app stores with a vast number of offerings. This could make it difficult for creators and investors to sell their VTubers or VTuber collections, as they may struggle to gain the visibility and promotion needed to succeed. The market may become dominated by a small number of influencers or celebrities who are able to generate the necessary hype to sell their VTubers.
It's worth mentioning that many VTubers are under agencies, who in most cases own the rights of the character, the story and the IP behind it, they are the ones who should provide a legal license to use the character and its associated rights.




Needs for a better VTuber marketplace 
There is a need for a better VTuber marketplace that addresses several issues currently facing the market. One of these issues is the need to generate sustainable liquidity for sellers, regardless of market conditions. This means that sellers should be able to easily buy and sell their VTubers even when the market is experiencing downturns or volatility.
Another need is to create a marketplace that provides equal opportunity for all sellers, regardless of their level of promotion or recognition. This includes providing opportunities for new and unknown creators to sell their VTubers and generate income streams from their intellectual property.
The marketplace should also work to eliminate scams and pump and dump schemes, which can manipulate the market and harm honest sellers and buyers. By providing a safe and transparent marketplace, it will be possible to increase confidence and trust in the market, which can in turn drive increased liquidity and buying pressure.
VTuber.exchange is an NFT decentrlzed exchange that aims to address all the challenges facing the market, including the need for sustainable liquidity, buy pressure, and the removal of pump and dump schemes. It does this by using quantum finance models to create the world's first NFT based on 100% liquidity protection through techniques such as Reverse Market Making, Decentralized Venture Capital, and IP income stream generation.
Unlike other NFT marketplaces, which are often centralized and built as peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, VTuber.exchange is the world's first decentralized NFT exchange to support both peer-to-contract (P2C) and contract-to-contract (C2C) transactions. This decentralized approach is meant to provide additional security and transparency for buyers and sellers.


Quantum Finance
Quantum finance is a new field that uses theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists to solve problems in finance. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe how particles behave at the atomic and subatomic level. Unlike traditional binary methods, which are based on two positions (0 and 1, false and true) and often result in a zero-sum game with high risk and limited possibilities, quantum finance introduces multiple positions that can significantly reduce risk and create liquidity even for non-liquid assets.
The VTuber.exchange applies quantum finance principles in a way that allows investors to simultaneously hold two contradictory positions: one as a buyer and owner of a VTuber, and another as a non-buyer and non-owner. This allows investors to potentially profit from their investments and then decide whether to finalize the transaction as a buyer or walk away, depending on how the market develops or the VTuber's success becomes.


Although quantum finance is a relatively new field, the team behind VTuber.exchange believes that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about finance and investment. They are proud to be among the first to bring this concept to the blockchain.


Reverse Market Making (RMM)
Reverse Market Making (RMM) is a liquidity solution that was designed to boost the non-fungible token (NFT) industry in a similar way to how Automated Market Making (AMM) has helped the cryptocurrency market during the 2019 bullrun. AMM has been used by decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap to provide liquidity to brand new projects from the start, without the barriers of traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs). It has also paved the way for the development of new lending, options, and derivative protocols, which are now an important part of the decentralized financial ecosystem.
RMM works by creating instant liquidity for any VTuber through a smart contract, without the need for a counterparty buyer. It allows buyers to reverse their trade back to the smart contract like it was a refund or cancellation order, while the seller acts as the market maker and benefits from the trade-off regardless of the outcome. This liquidity solution provides protection for buyers during the period of liquidity protection.


100% Liquidity protection
VTubera and VTuber collections can be difficult to trade due to scalability issues, limited liquidity, and higher risks for investors. These risks are exacerbated by bad actors who promote assets through manipulating their value and demand using fake wallets, and the lack of a guarantee of liquidity for sellers.
To address these issues, VTuber.exchange designed 100% liquidity protection solution for buyers. This means that sellers can act as market makers by offering buyers protection for a certain period of time, during which buyers have the option to return the VTuber to the smart contract and receive back the exact protected value in the same tokens that they invested with. This protection is available regardless of market conditions, helping to reduce risk for buyers and make it easier for them to trade VTubers.[1]


example 
Bob seeks to sell his VTuber for $1,000 while simultaneously earning a reward for acting as a market maker for future buyers. He employs Reverse Market Making (RMM) to provide the future buyer with complete liquidity protection for 90 days, in exchange for a 5% slippage fee in case of cancellation. This ensures that even in the event of a cancelled sale, Bob still earns a 5% profit over 90 days, equating to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY).
 
Lisa decides to purchase Bob's VTuber for $1,000 and transfers her funds to a Liquidity Protection smart contract acting as a safeguard. If Lisa finalizes the transaction, she will only have to pay the base price of $1,000 to Bob. However, if market conditions deteriorate or if Lisa is unable to resell the VTuber, she has the option to reverse the transaction and receive a full refund of her funds, minus any applicable fees and slippage.




Earning from making the market
Sellers who act as market makers utlzing the RMM have the opportunity to earn rewards in two ways: through slippage and by leveraging staking.
Slippage reward
Slippage reward is a form of compensation that sellers can request in exchange for offering a liquidity protection period. The amount of slippage is disclosed to and agreed upon by the buyer before the transaction takes place, and it is fixed rather than being unpredictable like it is on some decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Leveraging staking 
Alternatively or in addition to slippage, sellers can offer buyers low or even zero slippage in exchange for the opportunity to leverage the buyer's funds on a third-party decentralized protocol to generate passive income through annual percentage yield (APY). This can reduce the cost for the buyer to zero and provide the seller with enough reward to justify acting as a market maker. In both cases, the initial principal from the purchase is secured in a smart contract vault and is not sent to the seller until the sale is finalized.[2]
Benefits for sellers and buyers utilizing RMM
There are several benefits for both sellers and buyers to utlize RMM solution. Sellers can potentially increase their conversion rate and provide equal opportunities to new and unknown VTuber creators by offering liquidity protection. They can also earn rewards as market makers regardless of the sale outcome, and if they choose to leverage staking, they can keep any APY staking rewards earned. This earning while selling concept is similar to a traditional lease-to-own concept in the real estate industry.
Buyers, on the other hand, can hedge their investments and explore higher-risk and potentially lucrative new opportunities with the knowing that they can always reverse the trade back to the smart contract like it was a cancellation or refund without any tax triggers if they are unable to sell the VTuber to a new buyer. If a buyer agrees to a slippage reward, they will only pay it if they cancel the transaction and receive a full refund. If the seller is leveraging staking, the buyer does not have to pay anything in exchange for the liquidity protection; instead, the seller is paid by a third-party decentralized staking protocol such as Curve, Venus, or Yearn Finance.
Comparing example for seller
OpenSea peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace
Bob represent an agency that has 100 VTubers for sale at $10,000 each, totaling $1,000,000. Bob lists the VTubers on OpenSea and has a 5% conversion sale rate, meaning he receives $50,000 for selling his VTubers, while the remaining $950,000 worth of VTuber do not sell.




VTX peer-to-contract (P2C) decentrlzed exchange 
Bob use P2C to sell his 100 VTubers at a sale of $10,000 each, totaling $1,000,000. Bob lists his VTubers with liquidity protection for 365 days, and while his VTubers are under liquidity protection, he has a 95% cancellation rate (meaning the actual sale rate is only 5%, like on OpenSea). Bob receives $50,000 for selling his VTubers, plus an additional $95,000 from generating 10% slippage or APY over the $950,000 worth of VTubers that did not sell. This means Bob's total reward is 290% more than on a peer-to-peer marketplace like OpenSea.


Comparing example for buyer
OpenSea - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 
-          Lisa purchased VTuber for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her VTuber and she left with zero sum game. Meaning the
VTuber has no value.
VTX  - Peer-to-Contract  (P2C)
-          Lisa purchased VTuber for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her VTuber so she return it back to the liquidity protection smart 
contract and get a full 100% refund (minus VTuber,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee and pre agreed slippage if exist) if Lisa agreed to liquidity leverage instead of slippage reward, then lisa will get all her investment back fully (minus VTuber,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee)




Liquidity protection process
The liquidity protection process is a way for sellers to offer buyers protection against potential losses that may occur when buying and selling assets. The process involves the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the protection offered to buyers.
Step 1 - Offering
sellers offer buyers 100% liquidity protection for a specified number of days, and select a reward for the protection based on slippage or leverage staking.


Step 2 - Selection
buyers can select an VTuber that provides the desired liquidity protection and reward.


Step 3 - Sale and protection period
the slippage reward is sent to the seller immediately and is non-refundable. The funds covered by the liquidity protection are locked in a smart contract and, if the seller has offered liquidity protection with leverage staking, are also transferred to decentralized protocols like yearn.finance or Venus to generate passive annual percentage yield (APY) as a reward for the seller.


Step 4 - Buyer revokes Liquidity protection
buyers have the option to revoke the liquidity protection by returning the VTuber to the seller's liquidity protection smart contract. This triggers a full refund of the protected funds in the original token used by the buyer. If the transaction included leverage staking, the seller will receive the APY market making rewards and the buyer will receive their protected funds from the decentralized protocols in the form of a wrapped token (such as cUSDC or vUSDC).
Alternatively, if the VTuber is not returned to the liquidity protection contract during the protection period, the seller can claim payment from the smart contract once the period expires, indicating a successful sell.
Seller use case 
-       Imagine a seller of 100 different VTubers
-       The seller offers all 100 VTubers for $10,000 each (worth $1,000,000 total)
Thos VTuber are protected by liquidity protection in exchange for leveraging staking or fix slippage
-       Once received, the $1,000,000 received by the contract, it is automatically sent to Venus and/or yearn.finance with an average 10% APY or stay in the vault in exchange for immediate fixed slippage of let’s say 10%
-       During the protection period 95% of the VTubers are canceled and 5% are sold
-       For the 5% VTubers sold, the seller receives the full payment of $50K and the buyer receives back the VTuber’s
-       The funds for the remaining 95% of the VTuber’s that were canceled are returned to the buyer and the VTubers to the seller.
-       During this period, the seller generated APY above the $1,000,000 value of the VTubers, equal to $100,000
-       The total profit for the seller is $150,000 ($50,000 for the sold VTubers + $100,000 reward) representing 300% ROI over 50K sold VTuber supply.


Unlimited liquidity protection layers
RMM designed to increase liquidity and demand for VTubers in the same way that the Bill of Exchange, a financial instrument from the 17th century, increased liquidity for money. When a buyer purchases an VTuber with liquidity protection via RMM, the protection acts as collateral for the buyer. This means that the buyer can then sell the same VTuber to another buyer with liquidity protection, potentially at a higher price, and earn a profit. This process can be repeated multiple times, with the VTuber being resold to successive buyers with liquidity protection, potentially resulting in increased trading volume and value for the VTuber . The number of times the VTuber can be resold in this way is unlimited.


Incentives for buyers to create a buy pressure 
There are several incentives for buyers to create buying pressure for VTubers via RMM (Reserve Market Making) and retain or resell them in the future, such as:
1. Buyers can register themselves as future owners under the multilevel ownership, even if they bought and sold the VTubers at a higher, same, or lower price.
2. Buyers can earn market-making rewards that are larger than the rewards they pay to their sellers.
3. Buyers can at any time fork their VTubers and create derivatives or sub-collections, and then conduct an initial offering, but  they  can only claim the profits generated from these sales once their liquidity protection period has expired, as an alternative they can also sell the NFT along with underlying locked profits from the sub-collections to the next buyer.


Example of cancellation 
Bob purchases an VTubers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage.


Lisa then purchases the same VTubers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


Mitch then purchases the VTubers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


After 30 days, Mitch decides to cancel the purchase and gets back his $40,000 minus slippage. The VTubers is returned to Lisa, which automatically triggers her liquidity protection to return it to Bob and compensate her with $20,000 minus the slippage. Once Bob receives the VTubers, his liquidity protection is also triggered, returning it to the creator and compensate Bob with $10,000 minus the slippage.


In this scenario, none of the buyers in the liquidity protection layers are exposed to any principal loss. At the same time, each buyer who acts as a seller is rewarded as a market-making via slippage compensation, including the creator.






Example of completion
Bob purchases an VTubers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage.


Lisa then purchases the same VTubers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


Mitch then purchases the VTubers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


After 60 days have passed, the liquidity protection for Mitch has expired. As a result, Mitch retains the VTubers and all the sellers, including the creator, can claim their sales profits from the smart contract.


Regular P2P sales are FREE
In addition to the innovative solutions offered by VTubers.exchange, it also enables users to conduct standard peer-to-peer transactions (without liquidity protection) that are offered by other NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Uniswap, and others, at no charge and with 0% fees.


Expending P2C liquidity protection to P2P marketplaces
VTubers that have been protected via RMM can be also sold on peer-to-peer (P2P) basic marketplaces such as Opensea and SuperRare.
The liquidity protection feature remains linked to the VTuber even after it is sold, so that future buyers on other platforms can return the VTuber to the liquidity protection smart contract on VTube.exhange. This allows for the VTuber to continue being protected even if it is resold multiple times on different platforms.


The future of digital venders 
In the future, digital vendors that offer a 30-90 days refund policy “100% money back guarantee” no questions asked, may adopt the liquidity protection to ensure the security of their refund policies. With liquidity protection, buyers can trust any vendor, even if the vendor becomes insolvent, because the money they use to purchase a digital product is deposited into a secure smart contract vault. If the buyer decides to return the product during the protection period, they can use a decentralized trigger to call the money back from the smart contract vault. This allows for a hassle-free refund process with minimal risk for both the buyer and the vendor.
Derivatives subcollection
VTube.exhange's AI technology allows VTuber owners to create and sell derivative subcollections as new VTubers through an initial offering. These new VTubers can have unique terms set by the seller, such as value and liquidity protection. This solution allows buyers to generate additional income streams that may exceed the cost of the original VTuber. The income from the initial offering and rewards from the derivative subcollection are linked to the original VTuber and are locked until the original VTuber is no longer under liquidity protection. This model can incentivize buyers to hold onto the VTuber until the liquidity protection expires or sell it at a premium price with the included subcollection assets and locked value.


Fixed sale or auction
VTuber.exchange offers fixed sale and auction options for VTubers. Both of these options allow for the inclusion of liquidity protection and automated syndication contracts.


Automated Decentralized Syndication 
VTuber.exchange's Automated Decentralized Syndication (ADS) allows any buyer or seller to pool funds together to purchase an VTuber and automatically resell it for a profit. ADS acts as the owner of the VTuber and each ADS can only be used for one VTuber. All members of the ADS have an equal share based on their investment amount, and can claim their profits or refunded principal at any time without authorization from other investors. ADS provides is a security compliant, efficient, and scalable solution for group purchasing of VTubers, avoiding the security risks and potential deadlock of tokenized tokens that can occur with other syndication models.


Decentralized Venture Capital
Decentralized Venture Capital (DVC) is a fund with a potential no loss strategy[3]  that utilizes contract-to-contract (C2C) interactions and targets investment opportunities based on specific criteria, such as liquidity protection and specific collections. The DVC can be created by deploying funds or by acting as a General Partner (GP) and inviting Limited Partners (LPs) to contribute funds. The investment criteria for the DVC is set by the creator and automatically triggers the buying and selling of VTubers based on these criteria. The DVC creator, similar to a GP, has the option to charge a carry or success fee from the profits of their LPs[4]. DVCs are incentivized to add value to their portfolio through marketing, promotion, or by adding IP to the VTuber, rather than waiting for market forces to increase the value of the VTuber

Multilevel ownership
The multilevel ownership contract allows sellers to continue earning passive income from the sale of their assets even after the asset has been resold multiple times. This means that the asset will continue to generate profits for its previous owners. The income from each new sale is split proportionally among all current owners in real-time. This solution is fully decentralized and works even if the asset is listed and sold on exchanges that do not support this model.
Transaction fee 
When a purchase is made on VTube.exhange, a 2.5% transaction fee is immediately applied. After the fee is applied, the seller will receive the remaining amount once the transaction is no longer under protection. If the seller charges a slippage fee, it will be calculated based on the remaining amount after the VTube.exhange transaction fee. For example, if the sale price is $100, the seller will be eligible for $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, they will receive $9.75 immediately, and the remaining $87.75 will be locked under the liquidity protection contract. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VTX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the seller.


Cancelation fee
If a buyer returns an VTuberto the liquidity protection contract, the sale fee that was originally paid by the seller becomes a cancellation fee that is paid by the buyer. For example, if the sale price is $100 and the VTube.exhange fee is 2.5%, the buyer's liquidity protection will be $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, the buyer will receive a refund of $87.75. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VTX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the buyer.


Use of fees Breakdown
The fees generated from VTube.exhange are used as follows: 80% is used to buy VTX tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the VTube.exhange technology and to support the project.


100% fee reimbursement
VTube.exhange users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of VTX tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 


For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the VTX tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.


Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
Tokenomics
Digital Royalty Token
The VTX tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens (DRT) instrument tied and correlated to the business performance of the VTube.exhange project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy VTX digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining VTX digital royalty tokens. 
Digital Royalty Token vs simple tokens
Digital Royalty Tokens (DRT) are different from regular tokens in that they have an underlying value that is derived from the income stream of a project. This means that the value of DRT tokens is not solely based on speculation, like regular tokens often are. Instead, the value of DRT tokens is based on the real-time traction and success of the project they represent.
As a result, DRT tokens may be more resistant to market downturns than regular tokens. Even when the market is crashing and the value of other tokens based on speculation is decreasing, DRT tokens may still hold value because they have a potential return on investment based on their proven income stream. Buyers may be attracted to DRT tokens in a down market because they see the potential for the value of the token to increase based on the project's performance.
Pre-mint
The VTX digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.

Post minting
After the initial minting, VTX tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement smart contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.
 
VTX Price
Baseline Pre-sale via SAFT:                 $0.01 
Baseline Public sale via IBO:                $0.01
Listing price:                                 $0.02




Future split
Since VTX has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case, VTuber.exchange may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of VTX tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallet would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy VTX and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 VTX with a face value of $1000. The investors total holdings equals $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. VTube.exhange announces a split
3. VTX splits and distributes, to VTX holders, VTX proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 VTX, still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
